# **kf2-adding-maps-to-server**
Made using python3

To use:
Drop this script to the folder where you have all of the maps (They must end in .kfm extenshion)
Double click to execute and it will create a file called maps.txt
Then all you have to do is copy and paste the information to your PCServer-KFGame.ini folder of your server.

Note this is does not act as a server for people to get the files from, but you do need this in your maps folder.
A good server I would recommend is http://skillzservers.com/kf2-redirect/
To use skillz simple add 
```
[IpDrv.HTTPDownload]
RedirectToURL=
RedirectToURL=http://skillzservers.com/kf2-redirect/
```
to your PCServer-KFEngine.ini file
